This repository implements the famous Viola  Jones  Algorithm from scratch for face detection. Face detection is one of the challenging computer vision problem which involves detection and identification of faces in a given image. Some of the challenges in face detection include illumination, posture, occlusion etc.  In this report, the Viola Jones algorithm is mainly divided into three major parts, namely Extracting Haar Features, Finding the best haar Features on training data, and Finally, using Ada-Boost to develop the face detector.
